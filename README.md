# CmdStan

<b>CmdStan</b> is the command line interface to Stan, a C++ package providing

* full Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS), a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC),
* approximate Bayesian inference using automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI),
* penalized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using L-BFGS optimization,
* a full first- and higher-order automatic differentiation library based on C++ template overloads, and
* a supporting fully-templated matrix, linear algebra, and probability special function library.
