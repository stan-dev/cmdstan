# CmdStan

<b>CmdStan</b> is the command line interface to Stan, a package providing

* full Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS), a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC),
* penalized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using optimization, either Newton or quasi-Newton algorithms BFGS and L-BFGS,
* approximate Bayesian inference using automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI),
* a full first- and higher-order automatic differentiation library based on C++ template overloads, and
* a supporting fully-templated matrix, linear algebra, and probability special function library.

### Interfaces
There are separate repositories here on GitHub for interfaces:
* [CmdStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan) (command-line/shell interface)
* [CmdStanPy](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanpy) (a lightweight interface to CmdStan for Python users)
* [CmdStanR](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) (a lightweight interface to CmdStan for R users)
* [PyStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/pystan) (Python interface)
* [RStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan) (R interface)

### Source Repository
CmdStan's source-code repository is hosted here on GitHub.

### Licensing
The Stan-to-C++ compiler written in OCaml, core Stan C++ code, and CmdStan are licensed under new BSD.

Note that the Stan math library depends on the Intel TBB library which is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. This dependency implies an additional restriction as compared to the new BSD lincense alone. The Apache 2.0 license is incompatible with GPL-2 licensed code if distributed as a unitary binary. You may refer to the Apache 2.0 evaluation page on the [Stan Math wiki](https://github.com/stan-dev/math/wiki/Apache-2.0-License-Evaluation).

## Installation
1. Download the latest release tarball (use the "green" link) from: [CmdStan releases](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases)
2. Unpack the tarball.
3. From the folder, type `make` for a quick tutorial on how to build models.

## Installation using git
See [Getting Started with
CmdStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/wiki/Getting-Started-with-CmdStan) for instructions how to clone both CmdStan and Stan submodule.

## Troubleshooting

As of version 2.22, CmdStan has switched to the new Stan-to-C++ compiler, called [stanc3](https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3).  This compiler is intended to be backwards compatible with the existing Stan language and should accept all models that compile under the release 2.21 compiler, (see this [list of bug fixes](https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3/wiki/changes-from-stanc2)). 

If you experience any problems or noticeable changes in compilation, execution, or outputs of model after switching to CmdStan 2.22, you can temporarily enable the compiler used in CmdStan 2.21 as follows:

- remove the `bin/stanc` program (the stanc3 compiler)

- compile the stanc2 compiler as `bin/stanc`

```
rm bin/stanc
make STANC2=TRUE bin/stanc
bin/stanc --version
```

If using the old compiler fixes the issues in your model, please report a bug on the [stanc3](https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3) repository. Otherwise, report the issue to the [CmdStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan) repository.

To permanently enable the stanc2 compiler, add the following to your `make/local` file:
```
STANC2=true
```
to the `make/local` file. Then run `make clean-all` and `make build` again to build the old compiler.

If using the old compiler fixes the issues in your model, please report a bug on the [stanc3](https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3) repository. Otherwise, report the issue to the [CmdStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan) repository.

To switch back to the stanc3 compiler, just remove the existing `bin/stanc` program and re-run the make task `bin/stanc`.  By default, this installs the latest version of the stanc3 compiler.
