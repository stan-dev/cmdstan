- Add option `adaptation save_metric=1` to save adapted metric in separate JSON file with elements "stepsize", "metric_type" and "inv_metric" (#1203, #1229)
- New argument under `output save_cmdstan_config`. If set to `1`, creates `output_config.json` which contains the argument tree and extra information (equivalent to the CSV file header) (#1204)
