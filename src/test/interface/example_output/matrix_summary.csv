# Inference for Stan model: issue_342_model
# 1 chains: each with iter=10; warmup=1000; thin=1; 10 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took 0.23 seconds
# Sampling took 0.0018 seconds
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, ESS_bulk and ESS_tail measure the effective sample size 
for the entire sample (bulk) and for the the .05 and .95 tails (tail), 
# and R_hat measures the potential scale reduction on split chains.
At convergence R_hat will be very close to 1.00.
