Checking sampler transitions treedepth.
Treedepth satisfactory for all transitions.

Checking sampler transitions for divergences.
No divergent transitions found.

Checking E-BFMI - sampler transitions HMC potential energy.
E-BFMI satisfactory.

Rank-normalized split effective sample size satisfactory for all parameters.

The following parameters had rank-normalized split R-hat greater than 1.01:
  mu[1], mu[2], sigma[1], theta
Such high values indicate incomplete mixing and biased estimation.
You should consider regularizating your model with additional prior information or a more effective parameterization.

Processing complete.
