Inference for Stan model: bernoulli_model
4 chains: each with iter=1000; warmup=1000; thin=1; 1000 iterations saved.

Warmup took (0.0030, 0.0030, 0.0040, 0.0030) seconds, 0.013 seconds total
Sampling took (0.0090, 0.010, 0.010, 0.0090) seconds, 0.038 seconds total

Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
For each parameter, ESS_bulk and ESS_tail measure the effective sample size 
for the entire sample and for the the .05 and .95 tails, respectively, 
and R_hat measures the potential scale reduction on split chains.
At convergence R_hat will be very close to 1.00.
