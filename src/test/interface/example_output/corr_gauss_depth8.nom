Checking sampler transitions treedepth.
424 of 1000 (42.40%) transitions hit the maximum treedepth limit of 8, or 2^8 leapfrog steps.
Trajectories that are prematurely terminated due to this limit will result in slow exploration.
For optimal performance, increase this limit.

Checking sampler transitions for divergences.
No divergent transitions found.

Checking E-BFMI - sampler transitions HMC potential energy.
E-BFMI satisfactory.

Rank-normalized split effective sample size satisfactory for all parameters.

Rank-normalized split R-hat values satisfactory for all parameters.

Processing complete.
