# Inference for Stan model: bernoulli_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=1000; warmup=1000; thin=1; 1000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (0.0030, 0.0030, 0.0040, 0.0030) seconds, 0.013 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.0090, 0.010, 0.010, 0.0090) seconds, 0.038 seconds total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, ESS_bulk and ESS_tail measure the effective sample size 
for the entire sample and for the the .05 and .95 tails, respectively, 
# and R_hat measures the potential scale reduction on split chains.
At convergence R_hat will be very close to 1.00.
