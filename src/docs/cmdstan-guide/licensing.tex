In particular, the licenses for \CmdStan and its dependent libraries
have no ``copyleft'' provisions requiring applications of \CmdStan or
\Stan to be open source if they are redistributed.

This chapter describes the licenses for the tools that are distributed
with \CmdStan.  The next chapter explains some of the build tools that
are not distributed with \CmdStan, but are required to build and run
\Stan models.
