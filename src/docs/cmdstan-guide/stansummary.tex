\chapter{{\tt\bfseries print}: Output Analysis (deprecated)}\label{print.chapter}

\noindent
\code{print} is deprecated, but is still available until CmdStan v3.0.
See the next chapter for usage (replace \code{stansummary} with
\code{print}).

\chapter{{\tt\bfseries stansummary}: Output Analysis}\label{stansummary.chapter}

\noindent
\CmdStan is distributed with a posterior analysis utility that is able to read in
the output of one or more Markov chains and summarize the posterior
fits.  This operation mimics the \code{print(fit)} command in RStan,
which itself was modeled on the print functions from R2WinBUGS and
R2jags.

\section{Building the stansummary Command}

\CmdStan's \code{stansummary} command is built along with \code{stanc} into
the \code{bin} directory. It can be compiled directly using the
makefile as follows.
%
\begin{quote}
\begin{Verbatim}[fontshape=sl]
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> make bin/stansummary
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quote}
%

\section{Running the stansummary Command}

The \code{stansummary} command is executed on one or more \code{output.csv}
files. These files may be provided as command-line arguments
separated by spaces.  That means that wildcards may be used, as they
will be replaced by space-separated file names by the operating
system's command-line interpreter.

Suppose there are three samples files in a directory generated by
fitting a negative binomial model to a small data set.
%
\begin{quote}
\begin{Verbatim}[fontshape=sl]
> ls output*.csv
\end{Verbatim}
%
\begin{Verbatim}
output1.csv	output2.csv	output3.csv
\end{Verbatim}
%
\begin{Verbatim}[fontshape=sl]
> bin/stansummary output*.csv
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quote}
%
The result of \code{bin/stansummary} is displayed in
\reffigure{bin-stansummary-eg}.%

\footnote{RStan's and PyStan's output analysis stansummary may be different
  than that in the command-line version of Stan.}

   For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,

\caption{\small\it Example output from \code{bin/stansummary}.  The model
  parameters are \code{alpha} and \code{beta}.  The values for each
  quantity are the posterior means, standard deviations, and
  quantiles, along with Monte-Carlo standard error, effective sample
  size estimates (per second), and convergence diagnostic statistic.
  These values are all estimated from samples. In addition to the
  parameters, the value \code{lp\_\_} is the total log probability
  computed by the model (up to an additive constant).  The quantity
  \code{accept\_stat\_\_} is the NUTS acceptance statistic used by
  NUTS for slice and Metropolis rejection, \code{stepsize\_\_} the
  step size used by NUTS in its Hamiltonian simulation, and
  \code{treedepth\_\_} is the depth of tree used by NUTS, which is the
  log (base 2) of the number of leapfrog steps taken during the
  Hamiltonian simulation.  \code{n\_divergent\_\_} gives the number
  of leapfrog iterations with diverging error; because NUTS terminates
  at the first divergent iteration this should always be either 0 or 1.}

The posterior is skewed to the high side, resulting in posterior means
($\alpha=17$ and $\beta=10$) that are a long way away from the posterior
medians ($\alpha=9.5$ and $\beta=6.2$);  the posterior median is the
value listed under \code{50\%}, which is the 50th percentile of the
posterior values.

For Windows, the forward slash in paths need to be converted to backslashes.


\subsection{Output of stansummary Command}

\subsubsection{\code{n\_divergent}}

\CmdStan uses a symplectic integrator to approximate the exact
solution of the Hamiltonian dynamics and when the step size is too
large relative to the curvature of the log posterior this
approximation can diverge and threaten the validity of the
sampler. \code{n\_divergent} counts the number of iterations within a
given sample that have diverged and any non-zero value suggests that
the samples may be biased in which case the step size needs to be
decreased. Note that, because sampling is immediately terminated once
a divergence is encountered, \code{n\_divergent} should be only 0 or
1.


\section{Command-line Options}

In addition to the filenames, \code{stansummary} includes three flags to
customize the output.

\begin{description}
\longcmd{help} {stansummary usage information} {No help output by default}
%
\cmdarg{sig\_figs}{int}
{Sets the number of significant figures displayed in the output}
{Valid values: 0 \textless sig\_figs}
{default = \code{2} }
%
\cmdarg{autocorr}{int}
{Calculates and then displays the autocorrelation of the specified chain}
{Valid values: Any integer matching a chain index}
{No autocorrelation output by default}
%
